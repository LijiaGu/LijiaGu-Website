        My views on Planning: 1. Being able to write: writing is the most basic skill of activity planning. Copywriting, planning, and reporting are all kinds of styles that can express clearly and vividly. 2. Can calculate: basic calculation ability, activity evaluation index, budget, advertising expenditure and effect, result report and other data grasp. 3. Be able to observe: meticulous and accurate insight, make full use of the method of market research to make the activity strategy meet the market demand. 4. Organization: allocate the human and material resources that can be invested in the activities in an optimized way to ensure the smooth development of the activities. 5. Public relations: excellent public relations ability and appropriate public relations strategy can expand the influence of activities, such as media momentum. 6. Affordable: event planning is a delicate and difficult job. You have to be able to stay up late (even squeeze toothpaste) to write plans. When you are short of manpower, you have to be able to accept glorious tasks similar to porters at any time. Psychology and marketing are also indispensable basic knowledge. These abilities constitute the basic skills of activity planning. Put them into the specific work of an activity and disperse them in each work node, so "excellent ability" can make "excellent planning scheme". I think planning is not as difficult as imagined. A person with a gap in his mind doesn't need to write any planning book, but also knows how to do it. However, this does not mean that they are extraordinary and have the ability to "manage the world and the earth". They just have a reasonable estimate of the current situation, such as the task form, personnel allocation, resource status, situation purpose, what can be done and what can not be done, etc., and they are "confident" on the basis of this estimate. And planning not only appears in advertising and marketing, media publicity, but also exists everywhere in daily life. For example, chestnut, I want to eat KFC drumsticks, but it may conflict with what I am going to do. What should I do? Then I have to think, where is the nearest KFC store to me? How can I get there? Take a taxi or walk? How long will it take on the way? Is the time budget enough? If I need to be ranked, can I have time? The above is the logic of planning, OK, a series of ideas go in time, do not go in time, this is the implementation. So to sum up: planning = planning logic + planning execution + creativity. According to the above examples, we can also see that the planning is very close to us. The planning can be large or small, and the planning time can be long or short. Generally speaking, the planning includes several steps: first, the analysis of the planning object, then the time, content, etc. if it is an activity, the regional differences and the local actual situation should also be considered. Planning is the guiding ideology and specific strategy for you to implement something. And to consider the overall situation, such as an activity, preparatory, creative planning, implementation planning a series of processes. To put it bluntly, it is to do something to achieve a certain effect, set a goal and find a way to achieve it. Only in the field of marketing, creativity and communication are more needed.
